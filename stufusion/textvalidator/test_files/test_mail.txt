( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf  dear shareholder , addlrko  i am writing to you today to  discuss the new direction which your company will be  heading . up until this point we made it clear that  abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of  the market . our basic premise was to seek out  companies that can be turned into positive cash flow  businesses with the proper equity investment made into  them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;  with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we  expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant  positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the  various projects they are currently working on .  e - direct is another example ; we should start to see  some meaningful positive cash flow developing and  continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has  not maintained a particular industry focus . as of  today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir  last week we announced that abdv  will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to  future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,  a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start  of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in  locating and provide managerial , accounting and  financing for companies in the energy field , from oil  and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft  you may ask ; why the energy  related field ? simply it currently offers many  opportunities and with the price of oil approaching  $ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth  to be made in this sector . according to adjusted  inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak  of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis  of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem  to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand  for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this  year alone , most of which is because of china . the  increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the  bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30  level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented  in stone . there are more players in the world economy  today that require oil gas to propel their own  economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at  these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself  with individuals that have experience in the energy  field . these individuals will help locate viable  opportunities and the funding necessary to participate  in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira  so what do we do with our  non - energy related businesses such as fine wein  records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will  continue to incubate and nurture these businesses  until they are at a level where they can move on their  own . i believe that both of these companies will be  strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at  that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of  directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our  shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the  basic premise of our business module whereby we share  the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing  public our portfolio companies . we can then continue  to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw  by concentrating on a specific  sector such as the energy area we will be able to  define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our  goal will be to locate and make investments in no less  than four energy - related businesses over the next 12  months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an  investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative  way to participate in the booming oil gas and  energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm  fine wein records , inc .  announces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo  fine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development  corporation , inc .

( the bridge takes 2 minute for startup ) . each time these deals are sent / resent , it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart , thus magnifying the buildup of the queue .  the corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and / or enddate .  - dat truong

ham	Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 )  fred or anita ,  i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same  page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121  is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate  flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an  allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land  and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was  put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the  gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at  meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter  statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,  she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land  and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a  check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .  for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957  and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer  martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use  449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed  out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal  449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal  449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate  for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the  allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that  bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl  ( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis  funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .  in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a  callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume  should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then  byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land  and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and  the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general  land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on  that yet .  please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or  you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be  doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person  doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !

ham	Subject: king ranch  there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify  system .  1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this  gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and  king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that  there is a . 05 cent fee  to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl  at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas  will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is  not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input  a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 ,  or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas )  needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i  have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can  divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made .  2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow  from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my  understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had  their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this  meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement  should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) .  if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once  again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a  point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .

"" and i think the  responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""  shortly after the first blast , a  second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not  immediately known .  hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said  it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called  the fatah hawks .  there was no immediate information  available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah  movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .  israeli military sources said it was  a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the  post when the explosives were detonated .  it was not clear whether there were  palestinian casualties .  news video of the aftermath showed  soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely  wounded .  in a pamphlet distributed after the  attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of  the incident .  palestinians have used tunnels in the  area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack  down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard  an israeli tank shell exploded in a  gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,  palestinian medical and security sources said .  the children between the ages of 6  and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .  the violence happened in khan yunis  in central gaza  israeli military sources said that  forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells  being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .  in response , the forces fired towards  the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military  sources said ."

"" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '  enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .  the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .  it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .  enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .  third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .  "" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

""  by january 2002 , actual shareholders , not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time , and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain , decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value .  as of the end of march , its ' new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america .  since this time , the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales . these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project .  in addition , the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide . some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its , installed , maintained and supported by its , thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors . some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain . another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid , spain ' s telecoms center .  the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders . as such , its is :  1 ) building very little "" owned "" infrastructure for commodity services , utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators .  2 ) investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services .  3 ) investing in optimising its commercial dimensions .  the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners , such as : corte ingles , respol ( petrol stations ) and carrefour ( 220 stores ) .  the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain , including 1 , 000 post offices .  the company has pending contracts with a u . s . military base in spain , 15 adventure and marine parks , and a large chain of convenience stores throughout spain .  management team  gustavo g ?

spam	Subject: dear friend ,  dear friend ,  i wish to begin by way of introduction . i am williems tomu the first and only surviving son of late marc tomu one of the foremost and rich black farmers in zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe .  before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg - south africa , to deposit the sum of us $ 24 million ( tweenty four million united states dollars ) in one of the private security companies , as family valuables . when he realized the looming danger in zimbabwe .  this amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in swaziland .  this land dispute started when president robert mugabe introduced a new land reform , which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers ( my father included ) . this resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers ( mainly whites ) and the unlawful possession of their properties by mugabe ? s war veterans , under the disguise of fighting for the  interest of the country .  it is against this background that i fled the country with my family , to the netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum .  i have decided to seek foreign assistance , as the netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind , hence this letter to you .  all i need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities . my family ? s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets .  there are two options , firstly , you can choose to accept 30 % of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country .  we shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone fax numbers .  i await your reply through this email below willamstomuj @ netscape . net , ) ( williamstomul @ netscape . net ) while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction .  i shall furnish you with more details on request .  yours truly  mr . williems tomu

ham	Subject: ranks communication  after getting your imput , i think this is the best :  we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be  differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need  to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to  peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a  bonus ( may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a  better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be  different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization  and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution : doing  the right thing to learn business , but that contributions to date are not  significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus .  let me know what you think .  thanks  bob

ham	Subject: issues with measurement ( gary anderson ' s group )  it seems to me that there have been several issues recently involving data  feeds from measurement . regardless of the issue , you all seem to express the  same concern : a lack of accountability , no sense of urgency . . . . .  i brought this up in brian ' s staff meeting yesterday , in hopes to get some  ideas on where to go to get some results . rita , i understaood from you that  gary has returned your call and you are setting a meeting for later this  week . please include me in the meeting . if we don ' t get what we need , it  was recommended that i talk with ellis sturn . if that doesn ' t work , brian  will talk with rod hayslett . rita : prior to the meeting , would you please  coordinate the meeting and agenda , consolidating all issues / concerns ? yvette  can set the meeting .
ham	"Subject: marketing services / scheduling  daren ,  thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling  the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a  strong case could be made in favor of that idea .  it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,  nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge  base and the responsibility factor . it is a "" who ' s on first "" issue .  if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market  intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the  schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and  pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services  immensely .  as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and  more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes  they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .  i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to  handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to  think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only  person that should be involved in the industrials .  i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you  and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat  that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite  alright .  once again , thanks for listening .  ken  - attl . htm"
